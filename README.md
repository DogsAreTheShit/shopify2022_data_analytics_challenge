# Zane Chiang takes on the Shopify 2022 Data Analytics Challenge!

## Question 1:
  ASK: Calculate an AOV for a 30 day window

### a) What could go wrong?
  When creating a program to calculate an AOV for a 30 day window, I too first went to the simple solution of calculating the mean for the column using pandas libraries and naively calculated ~$3,145. Upon further inspection, I discovered 20 records with abnormal order amounts of ~$700,000. These being statistical outliers, I decided to handle these abnormalities by removing any records which fall outside of 3 standard deviations. This gave me a much more reasonable value of $723.26!
### b) What metric would you report for this dataset?
  Adjusted AOV

### c) What is its value?
  $723.26


## Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

### a) How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
  SQL Query:
  <SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM Orders AS o, Shippers AS s WHERE o.ShipperID = s.ShipperID AND s.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";>

  54
